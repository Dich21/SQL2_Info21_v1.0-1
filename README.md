# Info21: Academic Process Analytics

The **Info21** project is a system for analytics and monitoring of the academic process based on a specially designed **PostgreSQL** database.

The goal of the project was to create a flexible data model capable of storing and processing information about students, academic tasks, assessments, campus attendance, and interactions within an educational institution.

During the development, a comprehensive database structure was designed and implemented to efficiently manage academic data and automate data handling through stored procedures, functions, and triggers. This covers both direct data operations (such as adding and modifying records about assessments and attendance) and complex analytical queries (analyzing student activity, evaluating performance trends, and identifying relationships between participants of the educational process).

The system supports easy import and export of data in **CSV** format, simplifying integration with other applications and platforms. Additionally, tools were implemented for analyzing database metadata, making maintenance and further development more convenient.

Although the project was developed for educational purposes, its architecture and logic can be easily adapted for use in real educational institutions where tracking students' progress and analyzing academic efficiency are required.

To start working with the project, deploy a **PostgreSQL** database and sequentially run the provided SQL scripts to create the database structure, populate it with sample data, and execute analytical procedures.
